# Contracts: Bybit Futures SMT & Key-Level Real-Time Scanner (NY Time)

This directory will contain:

- Notes on Bybit REST and WebSocket usage relevant to this feature.
- Internal JSON shapes for key-level computation and SMT engines.
- Any formal schemas (if introduced later) for saved SMT events or user settings.

For this planning phase, the exact protocol formats are left to implementation while staying within
Bybit’s documented APIs and the data model defined in `data-model.md`.
